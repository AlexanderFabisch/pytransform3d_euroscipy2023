# Transformations in Three Dimensions

(Proposal title)

**Session type:** Talk (15 minutes)

**Track:** Scientific Applications


## Abstract

*Short Description (Compact description, used in schedule or social media)
Please write between 200 and 1500 characters.*

Rigid transformation in 3D are complicated due to the multitude of different
conventions and because they often form complex graphs that are difficult to
manage. In this talk I will give a brief introduction to the topic and present
the library pytransform3d as a set of tools that can help you to tame the
complexity. Applications in robotics (imitation learning, collision detection,
state estimation, kinematics, dynamics) will be the focus of this talk, even
though presented solutions are also applicable to other fields.
